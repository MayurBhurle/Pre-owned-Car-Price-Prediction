â—¦	Optimized regression models for car price prediction by managing missing data & feature selection.




The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model for estimating the price of pre-owned cars using regression techniques. Specifically, the study seeks to:
- Optimize regression models by handling missing data effectively.
- Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- Compare the accuracy of models trained on datasets with missing data omitted versus datasets with missing data imputed.
